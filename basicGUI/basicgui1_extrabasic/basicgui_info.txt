Run the guibasic.py file...

The commandBasic.py file accesses a message from the data.py file over redis
and is able to save it as a message in the command file

Then the gui imports the message from the command file, convert it from
bytes to a string, and then display the message

This trial shows the basic set up of import information from two married
redis files...

this does not feature the two being subsribed to the same channel...
