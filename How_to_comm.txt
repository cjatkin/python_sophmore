How to send python commands to RFSoc:
Connect host computer to rfsoc over ethernet cable

Choose an IP address for ethernet port on host computer that is of the same nature of RFSoC IP address but different final number
make sure address is set to Manual IPv4 and has a netmask that matches that of the RFSoC

on host computer, find redis.conf file in redis folder and edit IP bind to the IP of the ethernet port
You might have to comment out a bunch of bullshit, just listen to the errors 
Run 'redis-server ./redis.conf' from directory with the configuration file




IN a terminal from host computer, ssh into RFSoC and enter the rfborgcom folder and locate drone.py


Edit the drone.py file so that the redis server is set to the IP address of the host computer 
On Host computer, find commander.py file and edit so that it is bound to tthe IP address of the Redis server

From the RFSoC terminal, run drone.py
From host terminal, run commander.py
Pray
Choose corrent channel (at this time, python-channel)
Send commands
